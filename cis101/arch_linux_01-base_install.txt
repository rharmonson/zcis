# How to install Arch Linux

* VirtualBox *

This series of articles uses VirtualBox to install Arch Linux as a virtual machine. If you are unfamiliar with VirtualBox, advise searching for blog and youtube tutorials. Also, it has a manual found at https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/.

If using Linux, advise installing the VirtualBox package for your Linux distribution.

For Windows, download and install directly from Oracle.

## Obtain Arch Linux installer

Download the installer using bittorrent from https://www.archlinux.org/download/. If installing on a virtual machine, use the iso file directly, otherwise, use etcher or dd to write to a USB stick.

Etcher

Using `dd`.

```
lsblk (<-- identify the flash device)
dd bs=4M if=path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress oflag=sync
```

Boot using the media into a live Arch Linux.

## BIOS or UEFI?

If efivars does not exist, indicates probable BIOS system board.

`ls /sys/firmeware/efi/efivars`

## Keyboard Map

Accept the default keyboard map, US.

## Network Interface

If using DHCP, connect to your network, then test with ping.

```
ip link
ping archlinux.org
```

Use ctrl+c to quit ping.

# System clock

`timedatectl set-ntp true`

## Create partitions

Use `fdisk -l` view current devices. Using device sda as an example, we will create the following partitions for a BIOS installation (versus UEFI).

Mount	Device		Description	Size
--------------------------------------
none	/dev/sda1	BIOS		1M
/		/dev/sda2	root		25G
[swap]	/dev/sda3	swap		4G
/home	/dev/sda4	home		10G

When using fdisk, use "m" to explore fdisk's options. Execute the following commands in sequence to create the partitions as described above.

```
fdisk /dev/sda
fdisk /dev/sda
n
p
1
default first sector
+1M
n
p
2
default first sector
+25G
n
p
3
default first sector
+4G
t
3
82
n
p
(assumes 4 for it is the last available primary partition)
default first sector
+10G
w
```

"w" is responsible for saving our work. If you make a mistake "q" to quit without saving.

## Format partitions

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
mkswap /dev/sda3
swapon /dev/sda3
```

## Mount partitions

```
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home
```

## Install

`pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware iproute2 iputils man-db man-pages nano networkmanager reflextor texinfo virtualbox-guest-utils xf86-video-vmware`

## fstab

`genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

## chroot

`arch-chroot /mnt`

## Time zone

```
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

## Localization

Update "locale.gen" to use "en_US.UTF8 UTF-8" by removing "#."

```
nano /etc/locale.gen
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
```

## Network configuration

Using hostname cis101, complete the following.

```
echo "cis101" >> /etc/hostname
```

Also, update /etc/hosts

```
nano /etc/hosts
```

Update to have

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1			localhost
127.0.1.1	cis101.localdomain	cis101
```

## NetworkManager

`systemctl enable NetworkManager`

## reflector

```
cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
reflector --country US --age 12 --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

## initramfs

```
mkinitcpio -P
```

## root password

```
passwd root
```

## Boot loader

Install and configure grub boot loader.

```
pacman -S grub
grub-install /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Complete install

Exit chroot, unmount, and shutdown.

```
exit
umount -r /mnt/home
umount -r /mnt
poweroff
```

## Done!

After poweroff, remove Arch Linux installation media and take a snap of the virtual machine prior to moving to the next lesson.

This is a good time to enable copy+paste for VirtualBox. Using Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, select the Arch Linux guest, select the elipsis which is represented as three vertical dots, to the right of the guest, "Details", then "Settings." Moving forward we will use the following notation when decribing the use of the mouse in a graphical user interface (GUI).

Arch Linux guest --> (elipsis) --> Details --> Settings

In the Settings Windows, General --> Advance, select the drop down box to select Bidrirection for Shared Clipboard. This will permit copy, cut, and paste features using ctrl+c, ctrl+x, and ctrl+v between you computer and the Arch Linux guest for many programs. The terminal or shell uses the variations ctrl+shift+c, ctrl+shift+x, and ctrl+shift+v.
