# Customize Desktop Environment

In this lesson, we will customize our newly installed XFCE4 Desktop Environment (DE).

## Terminal

Before we start, we need to identify our Terminal Emulator which is our command line used for executing programs. At the bottom of the screen, we have a dock with icons. Go ahead and click on them to see what they do.

In order from left to right, the icons are:

1. Display Desktop - minimizes applications windows
1. Terminal
1. File Manager also known as Thunar or Thunar File Manager
1. Web Browser - will will install one later
1. Find or Application Finder
1. Home - list of location to open Thunar

The second icon from the left that looks like a black square with ">_" is XFCE4 Terminal Emulator. It is the application used to execute commands just like we did before installing XFCE4 DE. Prior to the DE, we were presented with the default "shell" on login. The default system shell is bash or Bourne Again SHell. Moving forward, the term "shell" will be instead of Terminal.

## Display

Using the "Applications" menu in the upper-left corner

Applications --> Settings --> Display

Update the Resolution from 800x600 to 1440x900, select the "Apply" button, "Keep this configuration" button, then "Close" button.

## Desktop: Background

First, let's create a place to save our pictures by opening a shell.

```
mkdir ~/Pictures
cd Pictures
```

To download files from the Internet using a shell, "curl -O" is used; letter O not zero (0). You can copy and paste the commands below using ctrl+c to paste and the shell varition to paste using ctrl+shift+v.

`curl -O https://wallpapersmug.com/download/1440x900/7a8c23/dragon-sea-monster-woman-art.jpg`

Additional images to images to download.
