# Applications

This article details how to manage applications using  pacman, Arch Linux's package manager. In addition, packages for common application are provided.

## pacman

List of common pacman options and explanations. Use of "pckg" represent the package to be managed.

* pacman -Q pckg - displays installed packages
* pacman -Ql pckg - lists all packages
* pacman -Qm - lists manually installed packages
* pacman -Rns pckg - removes package, its dependencies and configuration files
* pacman -S pckg - install package
* pacman -Si pckg - shows package information
* pacman -Ss name - searches packages where name is a string
* pacman -Sy - update pacman database, -Syy force update
* pacman -Syu - complete package upgrades
* pacman -U pckg.tar.xz - installs a package from a file

The most common options are install (S), search (Ss), update (Syu), and remove (Rns).

## Install Mozilla Firefox Internet Browser

Use pacman and update the local pacman database, then install Firefox. Note the use of "-Sy" need only done if there are packages updates which obsoletes packages in the existing pacman database. As a habit, advise "pacman -Sy" if it has been more than a day and installing or updating packages.

```
sudo pacman -Sy
sudo packman -S firefox
```

Firefox is now available in applications.

* Note *

When installing packages and receiving 404 errors, it may indicate the package doesn't exist due to an update. Refresh the pacman database using `sudo pacman -Sy`.
